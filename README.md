# Vibration condition monitoring with Deep Learning
Source code for training models for vibration-based monitoring. The models considered so far are Deep Learning-based and unsupervised, listed below:
- VAE
- BiGAN

The dataset was previously processed by extracting the signal energy content of the Wavelet Packet decomposition for multiple directions of vibrations measurements.
